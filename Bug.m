In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Specifically, strong reference cycles can easily occur when objects retain each other, preventing either from being deallocated. This often leads to memory leaks that only manifest over time or under specific circumstances, making them tricky to debug.
